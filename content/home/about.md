# Biography

Ying Zhang is a Ph.D. candidate of Bioinformaticsprofessor at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology CUCKOO Lab. Her research interests include yeast autophagy and functional post-translational modifications (PTMs), constructing easy-to-use softwares and databases, and proteome-wide analysis of PTMs substrates, etc. They are currently combining genetics, bioinformatics, and molecular & cellular biology approaches to study functional genetic variations that potentially influence protein modification status and phenotype.
